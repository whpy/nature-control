in this lab, we verified that under a very smooth initial condition, solver could run for at
least 40 time units (dt = 0.001). and the key representation S, the value would oscilliate no more
than 1.03, and the number of points with value bigger than 1.02, would self suppress the 
(no more than 4000, i.e. occupy the portion less than 1.6%).
