this lab beginning2 is inherited from beginning, the lab is created to 
generate the stationary form initial file. the end of also the beginning is
T = 408(0.002*204000). as colin do, we set the beginning last for around 4000
time units, actually the final aim is to make the total energy stable sufficiently
to distinguish the variation after add the advection term and the Rf term.
