this lab, the initial state is from the beginning/ and beginning2/,
where in beginning the field is run for 404 time units and 472 time units in 
beginning2 (dt = 0.002 both). The number at the prefix indicates the number of 
steps that have ran. 

in this lab, we decided to add the advection effect on the flow field. by numerically 
swithing on the advection term of vorticity w. Noted that we still need to keep the friction
term constant Rf = 0.00.
