this lab is created to fully verify the solver,
as stated in prl, there are three stage: first,
no advection $u\cdot\nabla u$ and friction coefficient
$R_f$, that is what we do in beginning/ and beginnning2/; 

then we switch advection term of velocity $y\cdot\nabla u$ on, that is what we do in advection/; 

lastly we activate the friction by set non-zero
friction coefficient Rf. That is what we do in friction/ .
